# My learnings

- How long did it take you to complete this assignment?
  - I'm not going to lie: it took me longer than I expected, probably around 7-8 hours. Mostly, because I wanted to complete the task using Vue 3 (I talk more about it in the "challenges" section), and because I was trying to make sure the styles are exactly the same as in the designs.  
- What about this assignment did you find most challenging?
  - Coming up the best implementation and making sure the ratio, and all the width/heights are accurate might have been the most difficult part for me. I thought uploading the image and saving it would be challenging since I haven't worked with that, but it turned out to be pretty easy.  
- What about this assignment did you find unclear?
  - When I worked with the existing designs before, the component system was put together separately (including all the headers' styles and so on), so it was easier to build the re-usable components and classes (that's something I like to start my work with usually).
- What challenges did you face that you did not expect?
  - I took on a challenge to complete the project using Vue 3, even though I have experience with Vue 2 mostly. I thought that it might be a great learning experience for me, and it truly turned out to be an interesting task to work on. Moreover, there were more difference between the two versions than I realized. At the begging it took me some time to figure out the best 'setup', but once I got the hang of it, it was a smooth sailing.
- Do you feel like this assignment has an appropriate level of difficulty?
  - I think it was a great assignment considering that it is a good reflection of the day-to-day at Streamlabs. However, it did take more time for me to complete the task, than intended.
- Briefly explain your decisions to use tools, frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, etc.
  - Since Vue 3 is the new default, I thought it would be a great practice to start using it on the projects going forward. Also, I prefer working with the Composition API (as opposed to Options) because I can organize the code in a cleaner and more manageable way. Tailwind is my go-to for styling the components, and I use it in most of my projects. Typescript is also something I use a lot, because I like type hinting variables, functions etc. where applicable.  
- Did you make certain assumptions and decisions around the UI/UX? Please elaborate on your reasonings.
  - I wanted to make sure that the application can be used intuitively, that all the cursor-pointers are in place, the modal can be closed as it would feel natural (even though it's not obvious from the designs) etc. That's also the reason why it took me longer to complete the task. There weren't many points where I needed to make assumptions regarding UI/UX, but I was doing my best to make sure the app is user-friendly. The only thing that I wasn't sure about is if there needs to be a functionality for removing the feed tile completely from the sidebar, and if so, what is the intended behaviour.
